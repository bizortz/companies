*(Autonomous step: resolve the relevant configuration/state described below before proceeding — no interactive prompt is required; use current project files and `docs/config-resolution.md` as the source of defaults.)*
## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

See `docs/director-gates.md` for the full check pattern. Individual gate definitions live in `docs/director-gates/[gate-id].md` — the spawned agent reads its own gate file; do not read it in the parent session.

This skill runs autonomously. Every decision it would previously have surfaced as a question is made by the owning agent and logged to `ops/decision-log.md`, per the operating rules in `docs/automation-modes.md` (the studio default mode is `autonomous`). The only exceptions are the fixed human gates listed in `ops/always-ask.yaml`, which always pause for explicit sign-off.

Determine the mode:

- `new` → generate a blank playtest report template
- `analyze [path]` → read raw notes and fill in the template with structured findings

---

## Phase 2A: New Template Mode

Generate this template and output it to the user:

```markdown
# Playtest Report

## Session Info
- **Date**: [Date]
- **Build**: [Version/Commit]
- **Duration**: [Time played]
- **Tester**: [Name/ID]
- **Platform**: [PC/Console/Mobile]
- **Input Method**: [KB+M / Gamepad / Touch]
- **Session Type**: [First time / Returning / Targeted test]

## Test Focus
[What specific features or flows were being tested]

## First Impressions (First 5 minutes)
- **Understood the goal?** [Yes/No/Partially]
- **Understood the controls?** [Yes/No/Partially]
- **Emotional response**: [Engaged/Confused/Bored/Frustrated/Excited]
- **Notes**: [Observations]

## Gameplay Flow
### What worked well
- [Observation 1]

### Pain points
- [Issue 1 -- Severity: High/Medium/Low]

### Confusion points
- [Where the player was confused and why]

### Moments of delight
- [What surprised or pleased the player]

## Bugs Encountered
| # | Description | Severity | Reproducible |
|---|-------------|----------|-------------|

## Feature-Specific Feedback
### [Feature 1]
- **Understood purpose?** [Yes/No]
- **Found engaging?** [Yes/No]
- **Suggestions**: [Tester suggestions]

## Quantitative Data (if available)
- **Deaths**: [Count and locations]
- **Time per area**: [Breakdown]
- **Items used**: [What and when]
- **Features discovered vs missed**: [List]

## Overall Assessment
- **Would play again?** [Yes/No/Maybe]
- **Difficulty**: [Too Easy / Just Right / Too Hard]
- **Pacing**: [Too Slow / Good / Too Fast]
- **Session length preference**: [Shorter / Good / Longer]

## Top 3 Priorities from this session
1. [Most important finding]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

## Phase 2B: Analyze Mode

Read the raw notes at the provided path. Cross-reference with existing design documents. Fill in the template above with structured findings. Flag any playtest observations that conflict with design intent.

---

## Phase 3: Action Routing

Categorize all findings into four buckets:

- **Design changes needed** — fun issues, player confusion, broken mechanics, observations that conflict with the GDD's intended experience
- **Balance adjustments** — numbers feel wrong, difficulty too spiked or too flat
- **Bug reports** — clear implementation defects that are reproducible
- **Polish items** — not blocking progress, but friction or feel issues for later

Present the categorized list, then route:

- **Design changes:** "Run `/propagate-design-change [path]` on the affected design document to find downstream impacts before making changes."
- **Balance adjustments:** "Run `/balance-check [system]` to verify the full balance picture before tuning values."
- **Bugs:** "Use `/bug-report` to formally track these."
- **Polish items:** "Add to the polish backlog in `production/` when the team reaches that phase."

---

## Phase 3b: Creative Director Player Experience Review

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning CD-PLAYTEST:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "CD-PLAYTEST skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 4 (save the report).
- `lean` → skip (not a PHASE-GATE). Note: "CD-PLAYTEST skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 4 (save the report).
- `full` → spawn as normal.

After categorising findings, spawn `creative-director` via `Agent` using gate **CD-PLAYTEST** (`docs/director-gates/cd-playtest.md`).

Pass: the structured report content, game pillars and core fantasy (from
`design/gdd/game-concept.md`), the specific hypothesis being tested. **If
`game-concept.md` does not exist** — expected at `minimal`, where
`design/game-brief.md` replaces it — pass the brief's pillars instead, and if
neither exists say so in the prompt: *"No pillars available — assess against
the hypothesis alone."* A director gate handed silence about pillars will
invent them.

Present the creative director's assessment before saving the report. If CONCERNS or REJECT, add a `## Creative Director Assessment` section to the report capturing the verdict and feedback. If APPROVE, note the approval in the report.

---

## Phase 4: Save Report

Write directly to `production/qa/playtests/playtest-[date]-[tester].md` and log the write to `ops/decision-log.md`.

If yes, write the file, creating the directory if needed.

---

## Phase 5: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — playtest report generated.

- Act on the highest-priority finding category first.
- After addressing design changes: re-run `/design-review` on the updated GDD.
- After fixing bugs: re-run `/bug-triage` to update priorities.

## Procedure

Follow the numbered/staged steps described above in order. Each step runs autonomously: resolve configuration and current project state first, perform the check or artifact generation described, and record any decision above specialist level in `ops/decision-log.md`. If a step would normally have asked the user a question, instead apply the autonomous decision rule in `docs/automation-modes.md` and proceed, escalating only per `ops/always-ask.yaml`.

## Output

Produce the artifact(s) described above (report, verdict, updated project file, or log entry) and write them to the appropriate location in the project (e.g. `production/`, `docs/`, or the relevant tracked file). Summarize the result back to the calling agent/team in a short status block, and append a decision-log entry if the output changed project state or direction.
